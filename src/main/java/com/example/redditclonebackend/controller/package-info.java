/**
 * A controller is the go-between for models and views.
 * It accepts the action (as presented by a view) that the user has chosen,
 * determines which models are relevant to this action, and passes those models
 * on to one or more views for presentation. We are using controllers in this project
 * mainly to transfer information between the models and the views, with our logic
 * in the models and services.
